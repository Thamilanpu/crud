Certainly! Let's break down the provided code step by step:

Dotenv Configuration:

javascript
Copy code
require('dotenv').config();
This line uses require to import the dotenv module and then calls the config() method on it. dotenv is a module that loads environment variables from a file named .env into process.env. It's commonly used to manage sensitive information and configuration variables.
Express.js Setup:

const express = require('express');
const app = express();
These lines import the express module and create an instance of the Express application by calling the express() function. The instance is stored in the variable app.
MongoDB Connection Setup:

javascript
Copy code
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const mongoString = process.env.DATABASE_URL;

mongoose.connect(mongoString);
const database = mongoose.connection;
These lines import the mongoose module for MongoDB interaction. The MongoDB connection string is retrieved from the environment variables using process.env.DATABASE_URL.
The mongoose.connect() method is used to connect to the MongoDB database using the provided connection string.
The database variable holds a reference to the MongoDB connection.
Database Connection Event Handlers:

javascript
Copy code
database.on('error', (error) => {
    console.log(error);
});

database.once('connected', () => {
    console.log('Database Connected');
});
These lines set up event handlers for the MongoDB connection. The database.on('error') event is triggered if there is an error during the connection. The database.once('connected') event is triggered once the connection is successfully established.
Express Middleware Setup:

javascript
Copy code
app.use(express.json());
This line adds middleware to the Express application. It specifically enables the application to parse JSON data in incoming requests. This is common when dealing with APIs that send and receive JSON.
Express App Listening on Port 3000:

javascript
Copy code
app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log(`Server Started at ${3000}`);
});
The app.listen() method is used to start the Express application and make it listen for incoming requests on port 3000. The callback function logs a message once the server is successfully started.
In summary, this code configures environment variables using dotenv, sets up an Express application, connects to a MongoDB database using Mongoose, defines event handlers for the database connection, adds middleware to parse JSON, and starts the Express server on port 3000.
